## About This Project
This project is a **web application** that embeds and runs simple **C# console applications** directly in the browser.  
The first demo app calculates the **day of the week** for a given date using **Zeller‚Äôs algorithm**.  

Purpose:  
- Showcase and test C# console apps in a safe, sandboxed environment  
- Experiment with embedding external runners (e.g., Try .NET Fiddle)  
- Serve as a learning project focusing on **security, accessibility, and minimal design**
