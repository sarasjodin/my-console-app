## About This Project
This project is a **web application** that embeds and runs simple **C# console applications** directly in the browser.  
The first demo app calculates the **day of the week** for a given date using **Zeller‚Äôs algorithm**.  

Purpose:  
- Showcase and test C# console apps in a safe, sandboxed environment  
- Experiment with embedding external runners (e.g., Try .NET Fiddle)  
- Serve as a learning project focusing on **security, accessibility, and minimal design**  

---

## Features
- ‚úÖ Embed and run C# console apps in-browser (via iframe, sandboxed)  
- ‚úÖ Day-of-week calculator (Zeller‚Äôs algorithm)  
- üîç Focus on **security, accessibility, and modular design**  

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Vite as build tool)  
- Netlify (static hosting & deployment)  
- External sandbox runners: **.NET Fiddle** (for C#)  
- Planned: JupyterLite or Pyodide (for Python integration in the future)
